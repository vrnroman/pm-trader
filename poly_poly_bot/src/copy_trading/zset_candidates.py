"""Set-Z candidates: the gate proposes, the owner admits.

The ruling (run-review s-p7w2ln): the gate may offer as many wallets as pass,
but final approval of which wallets go live is his alone, never gate-only. So
this module does two things and refuses a third:

* It renders every wallet that passes the go-live gate plus set Z's rails as
  ONE card carrying what has already been measured for it: the clean-era
  record, the real-quote replay with its own sample size, the entry penalty,
  the concentration rail with its reason spelled out, the share of profit
  that came from mirrored exits, the slice split, and how recently it traded.
  Nothing is ranked by return; cards are ordered by real-quote sample size and
  the header says so.
* Each card carries one button whose label says what the tap does. The tap
  re-runs the gate and the rails at that moment and only then calls
  ``zset.admit``, which has no force path.
* It never admits on its own. ``seed_zset.py --apply`` still exists for a
  scripted seed, and it calls the same evaluation, so there is one gate.
