"""Polymarket-side wallet history lookups.

Answers two questions without a local DB:
  1. What was this wallet's most recent trade *before* a reference timestamp?
     → drives the `dormant_reactivation` pattern (no in-memory state needed).
  2. How many trades has this wallet placed in total (capped at LOOKUP_LIMIT)?
     → drives the `new_account_geo` scalper gate, correct even after bot restart.

Both answers come from a single call to `/trades?user=<addr>&limit=50`, which
is deduped by tx_hash (takerOnly=false returns two rows per fill) and served
from an in-memory TTL LRU. Concurrent callers for the same address share one
in-flight request via an asyncio.Task handle, so popular wallets do not
stampede the Data API.
