"""Trustworthy promotion gate — the statistical floor a paper wallet must clear
*before* an offer to promote it to real capital (System A) is fired.

Why this exists: the promote decision used to be a bare threshold
(``n_settled >= 15 AND copy_ROI >= +10%``). Fifteen resolved paper bets is a
tiny sample: +10% over 15 bets can be pure variance, a handful of lucky
longshots, or fifteen correlated bets on a single event. This module adds the
rigor the shortlist gate (Strategy 1c) already has, but on the *paper-copy
outcomes* rather than the discovery dossier, so a wallet only reaches the owner's
"Promote?" button once its edge is statistically credible, durable, and spread
across independent markets.

Two design rules, both load-bearing:

* **Theory-agnostic by construction.** The significance test is on the *per-bet
  copy return* (t-stat of ``pnl/spent``), never on win-rate. A +EV longshot
  theory (e.g. 1e) wins well under 50% of the time by design; a win-rate floor
  would wrongly hold exactly the wallets such a theory is built to find. A return
  t-stat rewards a genuinely positive edge regardless of how often it hits, and
  it holds a high-variance edge for *more data* rather than blocking it forever —
  symmetric, not biased. The Wilson lower bound on win-rate is still computed, but
  only as a non-blocking honesty annotation next to the wallet's breakeven price.

* **Statistical floor blocks; the LLM review only advises.** Everything here is
  validated arithmetic and is allowed to *block* an auto-offer. The Claude
  promotion review (``llm_review.review_promotion``) runs on top but only
  annotates the surfaced offer — it never suppresses one, because the gate's own
  calibration is itself still unvalidated (see the holdout / backfill BACKLOG
  items). Statistical = gate, LLM = surfaced advice.

Pure and defensive: ``compute_stats`` / ``evaluate_floor`` never raise on
malformed positions; a wallet with too little data simply fails the floor with a
reason rather than throwing.
