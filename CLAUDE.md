# Project rules for Claude

## Testing

- **Always run the FULL test suite when changing code in this repo.** No subsets, no "just the relevant ones." Run every test in `poly_poly_bot/tests/`.
- The local venv at `poly_poly_bot/.venv` must have all of `requirements.txt` installed before running tests. If `pytest` fails on import errors (e.g. `py_clob_client`, `web3`, `pandas`), run `.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` first instead of skipping the broken modules.
- Command: `cd poly_poly_bot && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q`
- Reporting: state the actual count the run printed ("N passed"), not "all tests pass" without a number.
- **No test may depend on the wall clock.** A test that pins an absolute
  timestamp is fine; production code that reads `time.time()` where its caller
  supplied a `now` is not — that pairing is what turned the suite red on
  2026-09-14 with no commit behind it. Prove it before pushing:
  `CLOCK_DRIFT_DAYS=90 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q -p tests.clock_drift_plugin`
  (needs `freezegun`). The `CI` workflow runs this on every PR and nightly.
- Do NOT record a test count in this file or in ROADMAP.md. A hand-maintained
  derived number goes stale on the next commit and then misinforms; read it
  from the run instead.

## Ship workflow (poly_poly_bot)

After any edit under `poly_poly_bot/`, run the full cycle without asking:
1. Full test suite must pass.
2. `git add` the touched files, commit, `git push` to `main`.
3. Deploy is automatic on push to `main`: the GitHub Actions `Deploy` workflow
   runs the test gate, then **builds the Docker image on the runner** (native
   amd64), **pushes it to Artifact Registry** (`asia-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev/
   roman-vm/poly-poly-bot`), and the VM **pulls** it over Google's internal
   network (seconds — no VM build, no IAP tarball). Watch it with
   `gh run watch <id>` and confirm the container comes up clean. Do NOT run
   `bash deploy.sh` on this Mac — it builds + pushes the image and the Mac has
   no Docker (it's arm64; the VM is amd64). `deploy.sh` is for the CI runner or
   any docker-equipped host.

The VM (`poly-poly-bot`, zone `asia-northeast1-a`, project `roman-vm`) is an
`e2-small` reached only via IAP (`gcloud compute ssh ... --tunnel-through-iap`).
It has gone network-dead before (metadata server unreachable → SSH fails with
"failed to connect to port 22"); a `gcloud compute instances reset` recovers
it and the container auto-restarts (`--restart unless-stopped`).
