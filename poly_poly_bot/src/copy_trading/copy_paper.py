"""Forward paper-copy harness for Strategy 1b (execution-drag measurement).

The backtest (`backtest/trader_scoring_backtest.py`) shows that selecting copy
targets by realized closed-position ROI has strong out-of-sample edge — but it
assumes you fill at the target's price. In reality you see their trade *after*
it prints, the price has already moved, and you pay the spread to chase it.

This harness measures how much of that edge survives realistic execution. It
watches a watchlist of target wallets; when a target opens a BUY, it simulates a
copy entry against the *current* live order book (not their price), tracks the
paper position to resolution, and records both the realized PnL and the
execution drag (our entry price − their price). It places no real orders.

The core (fill simulation, PnL, dedup, ledger) is pure and unit tested; live
data access is injected so tests run without the network. A wallet graduates to
real capital only once its *copied* PnL is positive in this ledger.
