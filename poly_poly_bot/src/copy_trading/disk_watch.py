"""Disk-trajectory watch — edge-triggered WARNING before the disk fills.

The VM has one 20G disk shared by the data dir (caches, ledgers), the logs,
and the docker image. Both cache systems prune themselves (wcache since
2026-07-28, rescache since 2026-08-02), but the 2026-08-02 audit found the
disk at 84% with an unbounded cache growing ~100MB/day: nothing paged on the
*trajectory*, only the crash would have shown up. This samples free space once
per discovery sweep (6h), keeps a two-point slope in a tiny state file, and
trips when either the absolute floor or the projected days-to-full crosses a
bar — once per crossing (edge-triggered), so the watched channel isn't
trained to ignore a repeating warning.

Pure evaluation split from the side-effecting wrapper so it unit-tests
without disk or Telegram.
