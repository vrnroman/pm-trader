"""Set Z — the only wallets real money is ever allowed to follow.

The problem this exists to kill, found 2026-08-16: the live watched-wallet list
was `CONFIG.user_addresses + promotion_state.promoted_wallets()`, and that
promoted store still held two wallets one-tapped in July whose whole clean-era
record is 2 and 7 settled copies. Flipping `PREVIEW_MODE=false` would have put
real capital behind them. A hand-editable list is not a safety mechanism.

So Z is a store with exactly one writer: `promotion_gate.golive_check`
returning ready, plus one extra rail below. Nothing admits a wallet to Z by
being typed in, by being interesting, or by being promoted somewhere else.
`admit()` refuses a wallet the gate has not passed, which means the failure
mode of a careless caller is a rejection, not a live position.

Z reuses `promotion_state`'s existing scope mechanism (`scope="z"` gives
`promoted_wallets_z.json`, `copy_blacklist_z.json`, ...), so it introduces no
new storage concept: scope "" is strategy A, "b" is strategy B, "z" is the
real-money set.

**The drop-top-3 rail.** `golive_check` is a threshold on totals, and totals
hide concentration. One candidate this run cleared every existing bar with
61% of its book-B profit and 115% of its book-A profit sitting in three
tickets: remove three copies and it is flat. That is a lottery ticket with a
p-value attached, not an edge, and no amount of sample size fixes it because
the sample size is exactly what makes it look fine. So Z additionally requires
that a wallet still clears its ROI floor after its three best copies are
deleted. Cheap, blunt, and it is the one test the concentrated candidate fails.
