"""The thing that watches real money while nobody is looking.

Everything the bot does with real capital has a failure mode that has never
run: the auto-redeemer has never fired, `recover_pending_orders` has never
reconciled a real order, the proxy wallet has never been drained mid-session,
and the VM has previously gone network-dead for hours (with no positions open,
that cost nothing; with positions open it costs whatever the market does).

Two halves, deliberately separated:

* **Detectors** always run, in preview and live alike, and only ever log or
  alert. They are how the failure modes get exercised before real money exists.
* **Actions** (retry, cancel, self-disarm) are gated on `live_mode.is_armed()`,
  so today they are inert, and they become live the moment the owner arms
  without a second deploy or a second code path to trust.

Alerting reuses `disk_watch`'s edge-triggered shape: one message when a
condition becomes true, silence while it stays true, one when it clears. A
watcher that repeats itself every cycle is one the owner learns to ignore,
which is the same as not having it.

**Self-disarm is the one action that is always allowed**, even unarmed, because
it can only ever move toward preview. Anything that reduces live exposure
should be reachable from inside the loop; anything that increases it needs the
owner's key.
