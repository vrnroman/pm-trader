"""The rehearsal ledger: what the owner's actual bankroll would have made.

Every figure so far is a percentage on paper books of $30k to $111k. He is
about to risk about $310. So this re-runs the counterfactual for the set-Z
wallets at exactly his caps: each copy sized at the governor's per-copy cap,
the daily and open-exposure caps binding as they would live, every entry
settled at the real quoted book. The answer is in dollars, per wallet and in
total, with the window's effective start stated (real quotes only exist from
the day the prober went live).

Labelled counterfactual, forever. It never merges into /pnl or the verdict
memo, and it carries no verdict text of its own: a plain record of what the
same month would have done to his money, next to what the paper book said.
