"""Unified per-strategy + per-wallet P&L aggregation across both copy systems.

Two independent copy systems accrue P&L:

  * **System A — tiered live executor.** Realized rows in ``realized-pnl.jsonl``
    (each now stamped with ``tier`` 1a/1b/1c and the followed ``trader_address``)
    plus open inventory positions marked to market (``OpenPositionPnl``).

  * **System B — discovery → paper-copy harness.** ``PaperPosition`` rows in
    ``copy_paper_ledger.jsonl``: every position carries its ``target`` wallet and
    the discovery strategy theories (1a..1j) that ``flagged_by`` it. Closed
    positions are realized (resolution or exit-following); open ones are marked
    to market when a live mid is available (else they show as open count/capital
    only).

This module is **pure** — rows/positions/price-derived inputs are injected, so it
unit-tests without network or disk. It produces, per strategy and overall, the
realized/unrealized/net P&L and a per-wallet breakdown ranked for the
promote-to-real-money / drop decision.

Attribution & double-counting rules (see ``build_unified``):
  * One ``WalletPnl`` per (system, wallet). A System-B wallet flagged by several
    theories is listed under *each* theory's ``StrategyPnl`` but counted **once**
    in the grand total.
  * ROI denominator is *measured* capital: System A counts realized cost + priced
    open cost; System B counts closed (realized) ``spent`` plus the cost of open
    positions that carry a live mark — unmarked opens show as open count/capital
    only and don't drag ROI.
  * Rows/positions with no attribution land in ``untagged-A`` / ``untagged-B`` so
    the grand total always reconciles.
