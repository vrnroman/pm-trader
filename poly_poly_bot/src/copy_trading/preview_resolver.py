"""Paper-mode realization for the tiered executor (System A).

In preview mode the on-chain redeemer is gated off, so copy positions held in
``inventory`` would never realize — realized P&L would sit at $0 forever and
closed bets would vanish. This module is the paper analogue of the redeemer: it
checks each open inventory position's market on Gamma and, once the market
resolves, books a realized-P&L row (attributed to the position's tier + followed
wallet) and drops the token from inventory.

The classification + row-building is **pure** (a market dict and positions are
injected) so it unit-tests without network. ``run_preview_realization`` is the
thin live wrapper the periodic loop calls.
