"""Shadow quotes — what a real copy order WOULD have paid, measured live.

The pre-flip question this answers, in the owner's words: *how fast can I be
notified, and how much worse will my entry price be than the wallet I copied?*

Neither number existed before this module:

* **Latency** was unmeasurable. `source_detected_at` holds the *target's own*
  trade timestamp, not the moment we saw it (see `QueuedTrade`), so the gap
  that a real copier races was recorded nowhere. The detector now stamps
  `their_ts` and `detected_at`; the difference is the notify latency.
* **Entry penalty** was only ever *modeled*. Book A walks a simulated asks
  book and Book B stamps a flat +100bps by construction, and — decisively —
  book A's fill gate **censors** the copies where the book ran away, which are
  exactly the expensive ones. So the recorded drag is a survivor's average.
  This module quotes EVERY detected trade, including the ones both books
  refuse, using `order_executor.quote_copy_order` — the same function the live
  executor prices with.

Nothing here places an order, signs anything, or spends. It reads public book
prices and appends a JSONL row. It is deliberately additive: it never feeds
back into either paper book, so it cannot change what the pre-registered
2026-08-22 verdict measures.

Two samples per trade, `t0` and `t0 + SECOND_SAMPLE_DELAY_S`:
the first says what the penalty is, the second says whether *being faster
would buy anything* — if the book has already moved by the time we look
again, latency is the binding constraint; if it has not, it is not, and
chasing speed would be wasted effort. That decay term is the actual flip
decision, which is why one sample was not enough.
