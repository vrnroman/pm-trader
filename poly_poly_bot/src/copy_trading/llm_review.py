"""Claude gate on newly-qualified wallet candidates (Strategy 1c).

The statistical funnel (closed-position t-stat, lead-lag capture, entry
discipline, PnL-curve shape, copy-replay) is the gate that *narrows* the
universe. For the handful of wallets that survive it, this module assembles a
compact dossier and asks Claude for the qualitative judgment the heuristics
can't make — "is this a genuine informed/consistent trader worth copying, or an
artifact?" — plus its reasoning. The caller uses a ``skip`` verdict to block the
wallet from the paper watchlist (the final admission gate).

The call goes through the ``claude -p`` CLI, which runs on the operator's Claude
subscription (auth via ``CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`` — see ``claude setup-token``)
so no ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` is required. It is deliberately defensive: it
degrades to ``None`` on any failure (CLI missing, not authenticated, timeout,
non-JSON output) and the caller treats ``None`` as fail-open (admit) so a broken
CLI never freezes discovery. The subprocess runner is injectable for tests, so
the suite never shells out.
