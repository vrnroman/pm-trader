"""The bankroll governor: every live cap as a fraction of the money that is there.

Why this exists (2026-09-05). The live tier's caps were sized for a bankroll
that does not exist: $25 a copy, $200 open, $500 a day, on a proxy wallet that
holds nothing and an owner budget of about $310. Every one of those caps was
larger than the whole bankroll, so none of them capped anything. Worse, the
tier only copied a target's trade when it was $10,000 or more, while the
evidence that earned the go-live (paper book B) copies every buy from $300.
The live wire and the evidence described two different strategies.

So one number, ``LIVE_BUDGET_USD``, now derives every live cap, and the copy
trigger is the evidence base's own (``COPY_PAPER_MIN_USD``), so the strategy
that trades is the strategy that was measured.

Three rules, in the order they matter:

* **Closed when absent.** No ``LIVE_BUDGET_USD`` means no live sizing: every
  live copy is refused with a reason that names the knob. A preview session
  keeps rehearsing on the tier's own caps, because a preview with nothing to
  size rehearses nothing.
* **Never more than what is there.** Live, the effective budget is
  min(stated, on-chain USDC). The stated number is the owner's intent; the
  chain is the fact. If the balance cannot be read, the stated number is used
  and the panel says so.
* **Fractions, not dollars.** Per copy 2.5%, per market 5% (two copies a side,
  the executor's existing rule), per day 30%, open at once 80%. The shape is
  the owner's rubric (bounded downside per shot, many small shots behind one
  cap); the exact fractions are a stated default, each an env knob, not a
  measured optimum.

A per-copy size under the exchange minimum is NOT rounded up: a $150 bankroll
would then put 3.3% on every ticket instead of 2.5%, quietly. It is left under
the floor, every copy is refused, and the panel says what budget would open it.
