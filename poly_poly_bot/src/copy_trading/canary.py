"""The canary: one minimum-size real order through the whole live path.

Owner-promoted to build-now, twice. Everything measured so far prices against
the live book but never touches the CLOB, so it cannot see the slippage from
our own order hitting the book, signing latency, or whether the matching
engine fills where the pricing function predicted. The canary closes that gap
with real money, bounded to one ticket at the exchange minimum.

Shape. ``stage()`` arms a one-shot. The next set-Z BUY that passes every
normal rail (Z membership, tier, bankroll governor, drift, spread) is placed
at the $5 order minimum (or the market's own minimum if that is higher)
instead of the governor's per-copy size; the runtime arm is pulled the moment
the order is posted, so a second order cannot follow; the fill report posts
when the verifier sees the fill, as one row next to what the models said that
copy would cost. Unfired after 24 hours it expires and says so once.

It requires every interlock key. Nothing here can place an order on its own:
it only changes the size of the one the live path would have placed anyway,
and stops the rest. Staging happens by default on the first ``/live CONFIRM``
that has never seen a canary fire, so the first live session is bounded to
one ticket unless the owner cancels that explicitly.
