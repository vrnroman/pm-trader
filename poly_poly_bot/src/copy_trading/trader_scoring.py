"""Trader scoring for copy-trading selection (Strategy 1b).

Empirically validated approach for picking *which* wallets to copy.

Background (see research/COPY_TRADING_FINDINGS.md):
    Ranking Polymarket wallets by naive all-time PnL/ROI has ~zero predictive
    power for future returns — UNLESS realized PnL is measured only over
    *provably-closed* positions. The naive method counts still-open slow
    positions at a mark-to-market guess, which injects enough noise to destroy
    the signal (out-of-sample Spearman ~0.0). Measured correctly — realized ROI
    on positions that have either been redeemed or fully exited — past ROI
    predicts future ROI (Spearman ~0.29-0.36 across multiple time splits) and a
    top-quartile selection earns strongly positive returns out-of-sample.

This module contains the *pure* scoring logic (no network), so it can be unit
tested against fixture activity and reused by both the historical backtest
(`backtest/trader_scoring_backtest.py`) and the forward copy-paper harness.

A position is counted as realized only when it is "provably closed":
    - the wallet has a REDEEM event for that market (winnings claimed), OR
    - net shares across all outcomes have returned to ~0 (fully sold out).
Markets that are neither redeemed nor fully exited are treated as still-open
and excluded from the realized-ROI score (their mark-to-market value is noise).
