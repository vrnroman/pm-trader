"""Strategy #3: Tennis Odds Arbitrage — Smarkets vs Polymarket.

Compares Smarkets exchange odds (live tick-resolution mid prices) against
Polymarket tennis match prices and generates trade signals on divergences
above a configurable threshold.

Core loop:
  1. Fetch sharp odds from Smarkets
  2. Fetch Polymarket tennis match markets via Gamma API
  3. Match Smarkets events to Polymarket markets by player names
  4. Calculate divergence = sharp_implied_prob - polymarket_price
  5. If divergence > threshold, generate signal (BUY YES on underpriced side)
  6. Size using fractional Kelly criterion, capped at max bet
