# Roadmap — poly_poly_bot

**Written 2026-07-25** from a full read of the code, the production VM logs, the
live paper ledgers, and Langfuse. Supersedes `BACKLOG.md` (deleted; its one live
item is carried into P1-5b below, the rest was shipped).

> **STATUS 2026-07-28 (P1 batch SHIPPED, commits `6bc4837`, `b661126`, `+config`;
> 931 tests green):** P1-1..P1-7 all landed (details at the top of §4). Two prod
> findings fell out of the P1-1 load check: the discovery disk caches
> (wcache/rescache) had been **silently dead since ~2026-06** (dirs never
> created; every sweep re-fetched everything — 18 of the 24 min sweep), now
> self-healing in code; and the §1.7b holdout anomaly **resolved itself** — the
> first holdout fired 2026-07-27 16:03 UTC (the 22-day drought was the p≈5%
> unlucky streak, wiring was correct all along). The counterfactual clock
> P1-5b needs has started.
>
> **STATUS 2026-07-25 (same day, commits `ec84422` + `1ba9647`): P0-1..P0-4 and
> P2-1/P2-2 SHIPPED and live on the VM.** The fill model is fixed (0.97 floor,
> two-sided gate), `/pnl` and the AB-RACE snapshot carry at-their-price ROI +
> fill-health + split-half persistence next to the §7 kill bar, the race
> verdict was voided (`ab_race_state.json`: `verdict_sent:false`,
> `era_floor_ts=1784976482`), and `scripts/rebaseline_ledger.py` reproduces
> §1.2/§1.3 exactly from the live ledgers. **Open watches:** (1) P0-1's 48h
> acceptance (`rebaseline_ledger.py --era`, due ~07-27: avg drag ≥ 0, zero rows
> < −300bps); (2) the §7 kill-criterion clock runs on clean fills from
> 2026-07-25, verdict due ~08-22; (3) tomorrow's 08:00 UTC snapshot is the
> first clean-era one.

This file is meant to be self-contained: a fresh session should be able to read
only this and start working. Evidence and reproduction steps are included so
nobody has to re-derive the numbers or re-litigate the conclusions.

## 0. State of play

The bot is a Polymarket copy-trader. It is running on the GCP VM in
`PREVIEW_MODE=true` — **no real money is at risk and none has been traded.**
Two measurement harnesses run in background threads:

- **Book A** — lagged copy, fills simulated by walking the live asks book.
- **Book B** — instant copy, flat 100 bps slippage penalty.

Wallet discovery hunts candidate wallets into a watchlist (27 wallets as of
2026-07-24); an LLM gate (`claude-opus-4-8`) vets new admissions; a statistical
promotion gate decides when a wallet is offered for real capital; `/golive`
re-checks before the manual `PREVIEW_MODE=false` flip.

**The headline conclusion of the 2026-07-25 analysis: the system currently has
no measurable edge, and the apparent edge it reported was an artifact of its own
fill simulator.** No wallet is ready for real money. Details in §1.

Two promoted wallets exist in `promoted_wallets.json`
(`0x48611e62…`, `0x5674f607…`) — both promoted via Telegram, both now sitting at
`ready: false` in `golive_watch.json`, and both auto-demoted in book B. Nothing
is pending a go-live decision.

---

## 1. Evidence base

Recomputed independently from the raw production ledgers, not read off the bot's
own reports. **Do not re-derive these before acting — reproduce them only if you
change the fill model (P0-1), which invalidates the realized column.**

### 1.1 The fill simulator gifts price — this is the whole "edge"

`MIN_FILL_FRAC = 0.5` (`src/copy_trading/copy_paper.py:37`) lets the simulator
sweep ask levels down to **half** the price the target paid.

```
79 of 201 settled A-copies (39%) filled >2% BETTER than the target.
Those 79:  realized +$377.8   |   at the target's own price  -$157.5
           => the fill model gifted +$535.3
Book A's ENTIRE net PnL is +$537.5.
```

Worst offenders (the −5000 bps entries are the `MIN_FILL_FRAC` clamp binding):

```
drag -5000bps  their 0.560 -> ours 0.280   Bitcoin Up or Down - July 21, 5:35AM
drag -4797bps  their 0.517 -> ours 0.269   Will Japan win on 2026-06-25?   pnl +135.9
drag -3987bps  their 0.440 -> ours 0.265   Spread: Arizona Diamondbacks    pnl +139.0
```

Compounding it: `copy_paper.py:586` gates on `fill.drag_bps > fill_gate_bps` —
**one-sided**. Fills 1.5% *worse* than the target are rejected; fills 50%
*better* are kept. A filter that rejects bad luck and keeps good luck
manufactures alpha by construction.

### 1.2 The honest returns

| Book | n settled | Capital | Realized ROI | ROI at target's own price |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A (lagged) | 201 | $6,288 | **+8.55%** | **−0.11%** |
| A, clean fills only (drag ≥ −200bps) | 122 | $3,965 | +4.03% | — |
| B (instant) | 214 | $5,449 | −7.68% | −6.69% |
| **A + B combined** | **415** | **$11,737** | — | **−3.17%** |

Combined per-bet mean return **−4.05%**, SE 4.62%, **t = −0.88**,
95% CI **[−13.1%, +5.0%]** — and that is *before* Polymarket fees and Polygon
gas, neither of which either harness models.

### 1.3 Wallet selection has negative persistence

Per-wallet ROI split chronologically in half, all wallets with n ≥ 10:

```
A:  0x1e3b6822  1st +37.2%  2nd  +9.3%  HELD
    0x48611e62  1st +18.2%  2nd -15.4%  FLIPPED
    0x8dee870d  1st -16.7%  2nd +25.0%  FLIPPED
    0x161a7f66  1st  -6.8%  2nd -47.2%  HELD
    0x5674f607  1st +14.9%  2nd -23.8%  FLIPPED
    0x4a3f86ed  1st -12.7%  2nd  +8.2%  FLIPPED
    0x37c1ff27  1st +42.0%  2nd -20.3%  FLIPPED
B:  0x4a3f86ed  1st +10.2%  2nd  -7.4%  FLIPPED
    0xeef6ad0e  1st +37.8%  2nd -24.7%  FLIPPED
    0x48611e62  1st  +9.7%  2nd -29.7%  FLIPPED
    0x5674f607  1st +17.4%  2nd -29.8%  FLIPPED
    0x161a7f66  1st -44.0%  2nd -20.7%  HELD
    0x37c1ff27  1st +26.1%  2nd -17.1%  FLIPPED

corr(1st half, 2nd half) = -0.184 (A), -0.099 (B).  11 of 13 flipped sign.
```

A wallet looking good is, empirically, slightly *negative* information about what
it does next. **The bot has never computed this.** It is the single number that
says whether copy-trading works at all.

### 1.4 The "winners" are small samples that then go dark

Book A wallets bucketed by settled count:

```
n in [1,4]    17 wallets   $1,216   +12.6%
n in [5,14]    5 wallets   $1,349   +35.9%
n in [15,inf]  6 wallets   $3,723    -2.7%   <- the only ones with enough data
```

Every headline wallet (+80.5%, +53.3%, +22.0%) has n ≤ 11 **and has been dark for
22–30 days.** The wallets still trading sit at −12% to +4.5%.

Book A by week, settled: `W25 +60.4% | W26 +29.2% | W27 +15.5% | W28 −14.9% |
W29 −22.7% | W30 −15.5%`.

### 1.5 Category and price concentration

```
A: sports n=148 $4,402  -1.0%  |  other n=41 $1,455 +26.0%  |  crypto n=9 $375 +46.5%
B: sports n=185 $4,786  -8.8%  |  other n=17   $417  +4.6%  |  crypto n=5  $90 -22.9%
B price bucket [0.2,0.4): n=19, ROI -61.5%, win rate 16% (breakeven ~30%)
```

Sports is 333 of 415 copies and is the losing category in both books. The
positive slices are too small to act on (n=41, n=9) — this is a reason to **cut
the known loser**, not to chase the apparent winner.

### 1.6 The funnel is not searching

`WALLET_DISCOVERY_SKILL_POOL=40` (`config.py:404`),
`WALLET_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL_S=86400` (`config.py:402`). Production DISCOVERY log
lines, one sweep per day:

```
2026-07-19  swept=43 qualified=23 new=0 removed=1 watchlist=23
2026-07-20  swept=43 qualified=24 new=1 removed=0 watchlist=24
2026-07-21  swept=42 qualified=24 new=0 removed=0 watchlist=24
2026-07-22  swept=44 qualified=24 new=1 removed=1 watchlist=24
2026-07-23  swept=41 qualified=25 new=2 removed=1 watchlist=25
2026-07-24  swept=43 qualified=27 new=3 removed=1 watchlist=27
```

The same ~43 wallets are re-ranked daily. `consensus: ... 0 cells>=k · 0 new`
every single day — the consensus detector has never fired.

The top of the watchlist is ranked on raw wallet ROI with **no copy evidence at
all**: `roi=6.26 t=61.2 copy_n=0`, `roi=6.14 t=22.6 copy_n=0`. Every LLM
rejection says the same sentence — *"the classic signature of settlement-lag
scooping near $1 which a delayed copier cannot capture."* The screen manufactures
scoopers; Claude pays $0.09 a time to kill them.

Evidence intake is also throttled: on 2026-07-24 the harness saw 34,779 target
trade rows and rejected **28,334 (81.5%) as below the $300 minimum**
(`copy_paper_min_usd`, `config.py:191`), netting ~15 copies/day across the whole
watchlist. Meanwhile `COPY_GOLIVE_MIN_SETTLED=30` (`config.py:364`) and wallets
go dark after ~20 copies — **nothing can ever reach the bar before its wallet
dies.** Lowering the bar is not the fix; more wallets in parallel is.

### 1.7 Gate integrity

`data/gate-history.jsonl`, 71 decisions over 22 days:

```
verdicts: skip 28 | watch 25 | follow 6 | admit-fail-open 9 | skip-deferred 3
admitted: 43     holdout admits: 0     confidence bands: low 25, medium 24, high 5
```

Langfuse, 99 traces since 2026-06-29 (`wallet-gate` 88, `promotion-gate` 9):

```
verdicts: skip 43 | watch 32 | follow 7 | NULL OUTPUT 15 | other 2
latency: median 15.9s, max 45.2s      error traces: 0
total spend ~$8 (~$0.30/day), model claude-opus-4-8
```

Three problems: **(a)** ~13–15% of gate calls fail open — the wallet is admitted
unvetted and **zero error traces are recorded**, so the failures are invisible in
telemetry. **(b)** `GATE_HOLDOUT_FRAC=0.1` is correctly wired (`main.py:826`) yet
produced **0 holdouts across 28 skips**; expected ~3, p(zero) ≈ 5% — unlucky or
broken, unresolved. **(c)** the dossier the gate judges is full of nulls
(`n_closed`, `capital`, `hit_rate`, `concentration`, `mean_entry_price`,
`up_ratio` all `null` in live traces) while `why_flagged` simultaneously claims
"hit 100% over 455 closed markets, ROI +613%" against a `pnl_curve.net_pnl` of
$767.

### 1.8 Server health

Healthy. VM up 39 days, container `RestartCount=0` since 2026-07-17, load 0.11,
disk 7.0G/20G (38%), RAM 1.1G/2.0G. **No ERROR/WARNING/CRITICAL/tracebacks in
seven days of logs.**

The problems are cruft, not failure:

- **93.5% of log volume is noise** — 68,889 of 73,666 lines on 2026-07-24 are
  `urllib3.connectionpool` DEBUG from the Telegram long-poll. Real signal is
  ~4,500 lines/day. Root cause: `main.py:885` sets the **root** logger to DEBUG
  with a DEBUG file handler (`main.py:880`), capturing every third-party record.
- Log retention **works correctly** — `_purge_old_bot_logs` runs on startup and
  every midnight rollover; prod sets `BOT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=20`, so 19 days on
  disk is the configured window, not a leak. Fix the noise, not the retention.
- Docker json-file log driver has **no size cap** (`deploy.sh:178`), 18 MB and
  growing.
- ~14 MB of dead data in `data/` from strategies purged in `5f7a127` (2026-07-05).
- 1.05 GB reclaimable Docker images.
- **Port 22 open to `0.0.0.0/0`** via the `default-allow-ssh` project rule (hence
  constant scanner hits in journalctl). RDP 3389 and two VNC 5901 rules are also
  world-open. This VM holds a Polymarket private key.

### 1.9 Caveats on the above

- The −3.17% figure rests on `ideal_pnl` being computed correctly at
  `their_price` — verified at `copy_paper.py:153` and spot-checked against raw
  rows, but it shares the ledger's own resolution data. If market resolution is
  mis-recorded anywhere, both this number and the bot's inherit it.
- The persistence result (§1.3) is **independent of the fill model** and is the
  finding to trust most.
- n=9 crypto and n=41 "other" are too small to be findings. Treat them as noise.
- The holdout anomaly (§1.7b) is p≈5% — suspicious, not proven broken.

---

## 2. How to reproduce

Pull the live prod state (read-only; keys never leave the VM):

```bash
VM="gcloud compute ssh poly-poly-bot --zone asia-northeast1-a --project roman-vm --tunnel-through-iap"

# ledgers + gate + promotion state
$VM --command "cd /home/tianyuezhou/app/data && sudo tar czf /tmp/pm.tgz \
  copy_paper_ledger.jsonl copy_paper_ledger_b.jsonl copy_watchlist.json \
  gate-history.jsonl discovery_state.json promotion_offers*.json \
  promoted_wallets.json golive_watch.json copy_blacklist*.json && sudo base64 /tmp/pm.tgz" \
  | grep -vE 'WARNING|NumPy|cloud.google|please see' | tr -d '\n ' | base64 -d > pm.tgz
tar xzf pm.tgz
```

Core numbers from the ledgers (note `copy_id` is append-with-update — last row
per id wins, or you will double-count):

```python
import json, math, collections
def load(p):
    d = {}
    for l in open(p):
        if l.strip():
            r = json.loads(l); d[r["copy_id"]] = r
    return [r for r in d.values() if r.get("closed") and (r.get("spent") or 0) > 0]

for lab, p in (("A", "copy_paper_ledger.jsonl"), ("B", "copy_paper_ledger_b.jsonl")):
    rs = load(p)
    sp = sum(r["spent"] for r in rs)
    print(lab, "realized", sum(r.get("pnl") or 0 for r in rs) / sp,
               "at-their-price", sum(r.get("ideal_pnl") or 0 for r in rs) / sp)
```

Split-half persistence (§1.3): group by `target`, sort each wallet's rows by
`closed_ts`, compare `sum(pnl)/sum(spent)` of the first half vs the second,
then Pearson-correlate the pairs across wallets.

Langfuse (run **on the VM** so keys stay there):

```bash
$VM --command 'eval "$(docker exec poly-poly-bot env | grep -E "^LANGFUSE_" | sed "s/^/export /")"
AUTH=$(printf "%s:%s" "$LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY" "$LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY" | base64 -w0)
FROM=$(date -u -d "-7 days" +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ); TO=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Basic $AUTH" "$LANGFUSE_HOST/api/public/v2/observations?type=GENERATION&limit=100&fields=core,basic,usage&fromStartTime=$FROM&toStartTime=$TO"'
```

(Langfuse v4: the v1 `traces` list is removed on Cloud on 2026-11-16 — each gate
call is one root `generation` observation, read through the Observations API
v2. Always bound the window; page with `&cursor=<meta.cursor>` until none is
returned.)

---

## 3. P0 — the measurement instrument is broken

**Nothing downstream is trustworthy until P0-1 and P0-2 land. Do not tune
thresholds, promote wallets, or judge strategies before then.**

> **P0-1..P0-4 all SHIPPED 2026-07-25** (`ec84422`, `1ba9647`; 886 tests green).
> What landed beyond the letter of the items (owner asked "think what else
> could be needed", manager-approved): a standing **fill-health witness**
> (`copy_paper.fill_health`; avg/min drag, % better-than-target, deep-gift
> count, rendered in `/pnl` and the daily snapshot), a **divergence tripwire**
> (|realized − @price| > 200bps on ≥10 settled → `⚠SUSPECT-fills` + WARNING
> log — would have flagged the 2026-07 artifact months early), split-half corr

> `split_half_corr` can never fabricate a correlation from float noise.
> Deferred to the owner (see the end-of-run desk): whether `/golive` +
> `golive_watch` should also floor on at-their-price ROI + persistence.
> **RESOLVED same day (owner: option A): shipped `80e6dc4`, review-hardened
> `2668a81`** — the go-live gate now requires at-price ROI ≥ 0 on ≥5 clean

### P0-1 · Stop the fill simulator gifting price — **SHIPPED `ec84422`**
- **Why:** §1.1 — 39% of A-copies filled better than the target; that alone is
  the book's entire profit.
- **Change:** `src/copy_trading/copy_paper.py:37` — `MIN_FILL_FRAC = 0.5` → `0.97`.
  A credible same-side ask cannot sit 3%+ under what the target just paid; at 0.5
  the simulator sweeps stale book data.
- **Also:** `copy_paper.py:586` — make the fill gate two-sided
  (`abs(fill.drag_bps) > self.fill_gate_bps`) or add a separate favourable-side
  floor. `copy_paper_fill_gate_bps=150` at `config.py:217`.
- **Acceptance:** after 48h of fresh copies, `avg_drag_bps` in `/pnl` is ≥ 0 and
  no new ledger row has `drag_bps < -300`.
- **Effort:** ~1h incl. tests.

### P0-2 · Re-baseline both books from `ideal_pnl` — **SHIPPED `ec84422`**
- **Why:** §1.2 — the honest combined number is −3.17%, not +8.55%.
- **Change:** new `scripts/rebaseline_ledger.py` re-scoring
  `copy_paper_ledger*.jsonl` on `ideal_pnl` (already stored per row,
  `copy_paper.py:153`), emitting per-wallet and per-book ROI. Then make
  `pnl_unified` report **both** realized and at-their-price ROI, permanently and
  side by side.
- **Why this shape:** keeps two months of history instead of discarding it, and
  produces a number the fill model cannot inflate.
- **Acceptance:** `/pnl` shows both columns; at-their-price matches the script.
- **Effort:** ~3h.

### P0-3 · Invalidate the A-vs-B race verdict — **SHIPPED `ec84422`**
- **Why:** the day-7 verdict memo went out 2026-07-18
  (`ab_race_state.json: verdict_ts 1784361601`) on a book whose A-side profit is
  the P0-1 artifact. A +8.55% vs B −7.68% is fill model, not strategy — at their
  own price it is −0.11% vs −6.69%.
- **Change:** reset `ab_race_state.json`, restart the race clock after P0-1, and
  add the at-their-price metric to the `AB-RACE` daily snapshot so the next
  verdict cannot be won on fills.
- **Effort:** ~1h.

### P0-4 · Ship the persistence test as a first-class metric — **SHIPPED `ec84422`+`1ba9647`**
- **Why:** §1.3 — corr = −0.18 / −0.10, never measured by the bot.
- **Change:** `promotion_gate.py` already computes `second_half_roi` per wallet;
  add a book-level `split_half_corr()` beside it and surface it in `/pnl` and the
  daily digest. ~40 lines.
- **Decision rule — write this down before you have a result you are attached
  to:** if split-half correlation stays ≤ 0 on clean post-P0-1 data across ≥ 15
  wallets with n ≥ 10, wallet-copying is falsified. Stop investing in it rather
  than tuning it. See §5.
- **Effort:** ~2h.

---

## 4. P1 — actually search for edge

> **P1-1..P1-7 SHIPPED 2026-07-28** (931 tests; `6bc4837` cache+RAM fix,
> `b661126` feature batch, config flip as the tip commit so the 10× revert is
> one commit). What landed beyond the letter of the items (ideator field,
> manager-filtered): per-sweep **funnel telemetry** (I2: pool → qualified →
> gate → fail-open → holdout → admitted, one structured line), a **persistent
> cull-histogram.jsonl** (I4: the P1-2 acceptance share is trendable, not
> hand-counted), and a **cost sensitivity panel** in the `/pnl` trust block
> (I8: combined at-price ROI under ×0/×0.5/×1/×2 cost multipliers — the 08-22
> kill verdict now reads in real-money terms). Rejected at the gate: a
> copy-replay sample guard (redundant with the proven tier), a runtime
> dossier preflight (would fail-open or change gate semantics; the ≤2-null
> unit test covers it), a synthetic fail-open test path (would pollute
> gate-history calibration data). Re-watch items: (1) `new=` in the DISCOVERY
> line averages > 10/day for a week (P1-1 acceptance); (2) hit-rate-scooper +
> replay-proven-negative drop below 20% of the cull histogram (P1-2
> acceptance, readable from cull-histogram.jsonl); (3) first wide sweep's
> duration + VM RAM; (4) 5 Langfuse traces show no >2-null dossiers (P1-3
> acceptance); (5) P1-6 shrinks the copied universe the 08-22 verdict
> measures — a still-negative verdict then is *more* damning, not less; (6)
> vetting throughput vs influx — first wide sweep: new=72, gate_in=17 (the
> 20-call cap). Fail-safe (above-cap = admit-cap, paper-only) and mostly the
> cold-start flood, but if the admit-cap backlog is still growing when the
> 7-day new= watch reads (~08-04), revisit: raise the cap (cost exits the
> blessed $5–9/day band — surface with numbers) or triage gate-call order by
> P1-2 replay rank.

### P1-1 · Widen the funnel 10× — **SHIPPED** (config flip + `6bc4837` prereq)
- **Why:** §1.6 — `new=0..3`/day on a fixed 43-wallet pool is not a search.
- **Change:** `config.py:404` `WALLET_DISCOVERY_SKILL_POOL` 40 → 400;
  `config.py:402` `WALLET_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL_S` 86400 → 21600 (4×/day).
- **Watch:** e2-small RAM is 1.1G/2.0G used. If this strains the VM, that is the
  trigger to resize, not to stay small.
- **Cost:** gate calls ~5/day → ~50–100/day, i.e. $0.30/day → ~$5–9/day. Against
  the goal that is nothing (§1.7 — total spend to date is $8).
- **Acceptance:** `new=` in the DISCOVERY sweep line averages > 10/day for a week.
- **Effort:** config change, but needs a VM load check. ~2h.

### P1-2 · Rank the pool on copy-replay ROI, not wallet ROI — **SHIPPED `b661126`**
- **Why:** §1.6 — top-ranked watchlist wallets have `copy_n=0`, and the LLM gate
  spends its budget killing the scoopers the screen keeps producing.
- **Change:** make `copy_replay` ROI a **ranking key** in the skill screen, not
  only a downstream filter (`wallet_discovery_min_copy_replay_roi` exists at
  `config.py:428` — promote it to the sort). Wallets with `copy_n=0` should rank
  *below* wallets with proven copy-replay, not above.
- **Acceptance:** `hit-rate-scooper` + `replay-proven-negative` drop below 20% of
  the cull histogram (they currently dominate it).
- **Effort:** ~4h.

### P1-3 · Fix the dossier the gate sees — **SHIPPED `b661126`**
- **Why:** §1.7c — the model is refereeing contradictory, half-null inputs.
- **Change:** `discovery_runner._dossier_from_eval` — populate the null fields or
  drop them from the payload; reconcile `why_flagged` against `pnl_curve` before
  sending.
- **Acceptance:** no dossier ships with > 2 null fields; spot-check 5 Langfuse
  traces.
- **Effort:** ~3h.

### P1-4 · Make gate fail-open visible — **SHIPPED `b661126`**
- **Why:** §1.7a — ~13–15% of wallets admitted unvetted, zero error traces.
- **Change:** `discovery_runner._llm_gate` — emit a Langfuse trace with
  `level=ERROR` on parse/call failure; add the fail-open count to `/gate`; alert
  on Telegram above 20% in a sweep.
- **Effort:** ~2h.

### P1-5 · Verify the holdout branch fires — **SHIPPED `b661126`** (and the prod anomaly self-resolved 07-27: first holdout fired; drought was the p≈5% streak)
- **Why:** §1.7b — 0 holdouts across 28 skips.
- **Change:** unit test driving `_llm_gate` with a stubbed RNG asserting the
  holdout row is written (`discovery_runner.py` ~line 684); log the holdout roll
  at DEBUG so it is observable.
- **Effort:** ~2h.

### P1-5b · Gate calibration Phase 2 — *carried over from the deleted BACKLOG.md*
- **Status:** blocked on P1-5. Phase 1 (the holdout) shipped 2026-07-03 but has
  produced **zero holdout rows in 22 days**, so the counterfactual clock has
  never actually started.
- **The measurement:** join `data/gate-history.jsonl` to `copy_paper_ledger.jsonl`
  and report **admitted-ROI vs holdout-ROI**, sliced by confidence band and
  qualifying theory. The money question: do the high-confidence skips we
  holdout-admitted actually lose? If yes the gate is +EV; if the holdouts win,
  the gate is rejecting edge.
- **Why the holdout is non-negotiable:** a naive join only sees admitted wallets —
  a selection-biased self-congratulation loop, not a test. Do **not** ship the
  report without holdout data or it will only ever flatter the gate.
- **Discipline:** treat the first calibration report as evidence to tune the gate
  prompt/thresholds *by hand*, never to auto-change them. Keep the holdout
  fraction small and its exposure capped — by construction it admits wallets the
  gate thinks are bad.
- **Entry points:** `gate_history.py` (`summarize` grows a calibration mode, or a
  new `gate_calibration.py`), `telegram_bot._handle_gate`.
- **Effort:** ~1 day, after weeks of holdout outcomes exist.

### P1-6 · Act on the category evidence already in hand — **SHIPPED `b661126`**
- **Why:** §1.5 — sports is 333 of 415 copies and loses in both books, while the
  `approved_categories` filter (`copy_paper_live.py:506-520`) defaults to
  unrestricted.
- **Change:** flip the default from "absent → don't block" to "absent → require
  ≥ N settled copies in that category first"; add the same treatment for
  entry-price buckets.
- **Caveat:** this is about cutting the known loser. Do **not** tilt into crypto
  on n=9.
- **Effort:** ~3h.

### P1-7 · Model fees and gas — **SHIPPED `b661126`**
- **Why:** §1.2 — even −3.17% is gross. Neither harness charges Polymarket fees
  or Polygon gas.
- **Change:** subtract realistic per-trade cost in both books.
- **Effort:** ~2h.

## 5. P2 — hygiene

> **P2-3/P2-4/P2-6 SHIPPED 2026-07-28** (P2-5 stays owner-REJECTED). Beyond the
> letter of the items (ideator field, manager-filtered): telemetry **regression
> tests** pinning the envelope→Langfuse mapping + cost fallback + a
> **`telemetry-suspect` watchdog** (a successful generation with zero usage now
> WARNINGs instead of silently corrupting a week of cost data), an idempotent
> **`scripts/vm_hygiene.sh`** (archive+sha256-manifest+delete, prune, df
> receipts to `~/app/logs/hygiene.log`), and a src pin test for the deleted
> filenames. Two fell out of the run: **the deploy broke twice** —
> `deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x` now returns HTTP 403 and the old
> `curl | bash` (no pipefail) swallowed it, so apt installed the distro nodejs

### P2-1 · Kill the log noise — biggest win, smallest change — **SHIPPED `ec84422`**
- 68,889 of 73,666 lines/day are urllib3 DEBUG (§1.8).
- **Change:** add `"urllib3"`, `"urllib3.connectionpool"`, `"web3"`, `"asyncio"`
  to the noisy tuple at `src/logger.py:208`.
- **Effect:** 16 MB/day → ~1 MB/day; 327 MB → ~20 MB at the same 20-day
  retention. **Leave `BOT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=20` alone** — retention is not the
  problem.
- **Effort:** 5 min.

### P2-2 · Cap the Docker json log — **SHIPPED `ec84422`**
`deploy.sh:178` has no `--log-opt`. Add
`--log-opt max-size=50m --log-opt max-file=3`. **5 min.**

### P2-3 · Delete dead strategy data — **SHIPPED** (archive + sha256 manifest in `~/app/data/archive/`, then delete; orphans included)
`tennis_scan_metrics.jsonl` (12 MB), `tennis_trades.jsonl`,
`tennis_bet_state.json`, `tennis_paper_book.json`, `weather_trades.jsonl` — ~14 MB
from strategies purged in `5f7a127` (2026-07-05). Archive, then delete. **15 min.**

### P2-4 · Prune Docker images — **SHIPPED** (reclaimed 1.052 GB, df receipt in `hygiene.log`)
1.05 GB reclaimable (`poly-poly-bot:latest` 933 MB, 5 weeks old).
`docker image prune -a`. **5 min.**

### P2-5 · Close the world-open ports — **REJECTED by owner (2026-07-25, do not re-pitch)**
`default-allow-ssh` permits `tcp:22` from `0.0.0.0/0`; `allow-iap-ssh`
(35.235.240.0/20) already covers real access. Also world-open:
`default-allow-rdp` (3389), `allow-vnc-5901` and `llow-vnc` (5901).
- **Blocked on owner:** these are project-wide defaults — confirm no other
  `roman-vm` instance depends on them before deleting.
- **Effort:** 30 min incl. the check.

### P2-6 · Fix Langfuse usage accounting — **SHIPPED `7adc2e3`**
Input tokens report as 2–6/call since ~2026-07-11 (vs 3,000–5,000 before);
2026-07-11 → 07-14 report `totalCost: 0`. Post-07-11 costs are understated.
Check the usage payload in `src/copy_trading/langfuse_telemetry.py`. **1h.**

## 6. Sequence

1. **First 10 minutes:** P2-1, P2-2.
2. **Then:** P0-1 → P0-2 → P0-3. This is the set that stops the bleeding.
3. **Then:** P0-4.
4. **Then:** P1-1 + P1-2 together — they are the same funnel fix from two ends.
5. **Then:** P1-3, P1-4, P1-5 as one batch (all gate integrity), unblocking P1-5b.
6. **Opportunistically:** P1-6, P1-7, P2-3/4/5/6.

**Framing:** P0 does not find edge. It tells you whether the edge you thought you
had is real — and the current read is that it is not. P1 is the bet that a 10×
wider search finds something a 40-wallet pool could not.

---

## 7. Kill criterion

Agree this now, while it is cheap:

> After P0-1 ships and ≥ 4 weeks of clean fills have accrued, if the combined
> at-their-price ROI is still negative **and** split-half correlation (P0-4) is
> still ≤ 0 across ≥ 15 wallets with n ≥ 10, then wallet-copying on Polymarket is
> falsified for this approach. Stop tuning it. Either pivot the search to rules
> and market structure rather than wallet identity, or stop.

The failure mode this guards against is the one the codebase has already shown:
a wallet looks good at n=7, gets promoted, decays, gets blacklisted, and the
cycle repeats with the next small sample.

---

## 8. Operational reference

- **VM:** `poly-poly-bot`, zone `asia-northeast1-a`, project `roman-vm`,
  `e2-small`, IAP-only access
  (`gcloud compute ssh poly-poly-bot --zone asia-northeast1-a --project roman-vm --tunnel-through-iap`).
- **Volumes:** `~/app/{data,logs,cache,results}` → `/app/...` in the container.
- **It has gone network-dead before** (metadata server unreachable → SSH fails
  with "failed to connect to port 22"). `gcloud compute instances reset` recovers
  it; the container auto-restarts (`--restart unless-stopped`).
- **Ship workflow** (see `CLAUDE.md`): full test suite must pass (count comes
  from the run, not from this file;
  `cd poly_poly_bot && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q`) → commit → push to
  `main` → GitHub Actions builds amd64 and pushes to Artifact Registry, VM pulls.
  Watch with `gh run watch <id>`. **Never** run `bash deploy.sh` on the Mac — it
  is arm64 and has no Docker.
- **Report the test count the run printed**, never "all tests pass" without a
  number — and never copy that count into this file (see `CLAUDE.md`).

default of `7.0` — that is what puts the verdict on 08-22, so do not read the
clock off `config.py`. Anything not listed here runs on `config.py` defaults.

## 9. Inspection s-r7m3qk — 2026-08-02 (second pass over the health batch)

A full re-read of the four `feat/fix(health)` commits plus the money path,
against the **live VM**, not just the code. What shipped is enumerated in §9.1;
what is still open is enumerated in §9.2 (verdict-integrity, before 08-22) and
§9.3 (lower). Counts are deliberately not restated here — the lists are the
tally, and a hand-maintained summary number is exactly what went stale twice
during this session.

**Framing for the next session:** protect the 08-22 verdict from being voided
or made unreadable, and arrive on 08-22 with the pivot's evidence in hand.

### 9.1 SHIPPED

- **The §7 verdict memo could never have been delivered.** `_bucket` renders a
  literal `<$25`; the memo is `parse_mode="HTML"`. Verified against the live
  Telegram API: `400 can't parse entities: Unsupported start tag "$25"`, and
  `<pre>` does not protect it. `main.py` only sets `verdict_sent` when
  `_send_chunked` returns True, so on 2026-08-22 the memo would have failed,
  re-fired every morning forever, and `/verdict` would never have armed.
  Labels are now `under $25`; a test asserts no Telegram-bound line contains
  `<`; and `send_message` retries once as plain text on a parse error so no
  future market-derived string can cost a message.
- **`/setkey` echoed the private key** for every input shape except the one the
  redaction regex matched (bare key with no `0x` — which `config_validators`
  accepts; `/setkey@botname`; a typo'd `CONFIRM`). Arguments are now dropped
  wholesale. **No key or token was found in any current log or data file.**
- **Disk ~1 day from full.** disk-watch TRIPPED 11:41 UTC: `free 4.1G shrinking
  1521MB/day`. `prune_cache` bounded wcache by FILE COUNT; entry size is the
  wallet's history length, so 4000 files had grown to **8.2G of a 20G disk**.
  Now budgeted in bytes and *derived from free space* via a reserve, rather
  than another hand-picked constant (that has gone stale twice: 37GB in P2,
  8.2GB now). Also pruned at sweep END. rescache count cap 120k → 400k: at
  ~90k writes/sweep an entry survived ~1.3 sweeps, so it was mostly paying to
  write files it deleted before reuse.
- **A failed `/activity` fetch was cached as truth.** `_get` returns `None`
  after four attempts; the caller could not tell that from "no more trades" and
  wrote the empty/truncated list to cache for the full 24h TTL. 18 wallets held
  a cached `[]`. A genuine `[]` is still cached; an incomplete fetch never is,
  and the sweep now WARNs with a count (the discovery path previously logged
  **nothing at all** on a failed fetch).
- **`bot-*.log` could not report a problem.** `_OperationalFilter` sent WARNING+
  *exclusively* to `signals-*.log`. Grepping the operational log returned a
  clean sheet while 261 warnings/day and a tripped disk alarm sat elsewhere.
  WARNING+ now goes to both. *(If you grep prod logs, know that `bot-*.log` was
  blind to warnings before 2026-08-02.)*
- **The go-live gate could bless real money on artifact-era evidence.**
  `compute_stats` has no era parameter, so every *realized* bar not labelled
  "clean era" is all-time — the number P0-1 voided — while the honest
  checks need only a handful of clean settles and a 3-wallet correlation. New blocking bar:
  `COPY_GOLIVE_MIN_CLEAN_SETTLED` (default 30).
- **The P1-6 evidence gate read dust fills.** A dust loss is capped at −1/row but a dust **win is unbounded**:
  one row that swept a stale 0.001 ask returns +$49,950 on $50 and can drag a
  whole losing category positive, so the block never fires. One-directional:
  it can only push toward admitting.
- **§7 readability witness.** Nothing watched whether ≥15 wallets at n≥10 would
  actually exist on 08-22. A pre-registered falsification that quietly never
  resolves is worse than either outcome. Now on the daily snapshot.

### 9.2 QUEUED — verdict-integrity, do before 08-22

- **P1-7 charges a ROUND-TRIP spread against a book that redeems at par.**
  `copy_cost.py` assumes "sell or redeem at the bid", but `copy_paper.realize()`
  sets `payout = shares` — a winning share settles at $1.00, no spread. The
  exit half is only actually paid on `realize_exit` rows, yet `ideal_cost_usd`
  charges the full round trip on **every** row at open, so every `@net` figure
  is biased negative. **Do not quote a number for this from here** — it moves
  daily and this file has already carried a stale one; read it live from
  `/pnl`'s cost-sensitivity panel or `scripts/rebaseline_ledger.py --era`.
  **Interim: read the ×0.5 sensitivity column as the primary, not ×1.**
  This does NOT decide whether §7 fires — §7 and §9.4's arms are defined on
  **gross** at-price ROI and correlation, neither of which is a function of
  modeled cost (§9.8). It decides the separate ECONOMIC read: whether there is
  money in this after costs. (Do not read that as "@net is the only negative
  figure" — it is not: book A is negative at at-their-price too, on both
  windows. The COMBINED figures the §7 arms read are the ones where @net is
  the sole negative.)
- **`at-their-price` ROI is not fill-model-independent.** `ideal_pnl` uses
  `their_price` but every consumer divides by `spent = shares·entry_price`, so
  `reported = true × (their_price/entry_price)`. Clean era is bounded by the
  fill gate (±1.5%) so the §7 sign is safe; **all-time** figures are not — a
  0.5× legacy fill doubles the reported number, and those rows were kept
  deliberately "to show their honest economics". Fix: accumulate
  `ideal_cost_basis = Σ shares·their_price` and divide by that.
- **`/verdict recalibrate` does not do what it says.** It writes an *absolute*
  `AB_RACE_VERDICT_DAYS=30` against a fixed `era_start`, so 27→30 is **+3 days,
  not +30** (the UI says "extend era 30d"). A second recalibrate is a no-op
  that also clears `verdict_sent`, so the memo re-posts the next morning — the
  "extend" knob becomes a daily-memo loop. It also immediately re-disarms
  `/verdict` itself, with no way back.
- **Autopsy fingerprints never expire.** `seen_fps[fp] = now` is never pruned,
  so a fixed-then-recurring anomaly is silent **forever** — precisely the
  −$575 double-write class the module exists to catch. Also `_save_state` sits
  inside the broad `except Exception: pass`, so one raise re-alerts everything
  daily and records no size baseline.
- **Admit-cap wallets are admitted permanently unvetted.** Past
  `llm_review_top_n` (20) a wallet is recorded `admit-cap, admitted=True` with
  **no queue entry**; next sweep it is in `prev_on` and never gated again. Cap
  is 500, so up to 480 unvetted admits in one sweep. `_maybe_alert_gate_failopen`
  excludes admit-cap from both terms, so a sweep that gates 20 and admits 52
  ungated raises **no alert**. Note: the P1 watch item "if the admit-cap
  backlog is still growing" **cannot be satisfied — there is no backlog.**
- **`paper_proven_wallets` is all-time realized**, so artifact-era gift fills
  grant the highest-privilege discovery path (force-include, bypasses tail-ratio
  / drawdown / scooper / category gates, ranks first under cap pressure). Five
  pre-fix gifted settles at any positive ROI is enough.

### 9.3 QUEUED — lower

- `disk_watch.check` skips `_save_state` when the Telegram send raises, so a
  persistently broken Telegram degrades the trajectory alarm to floor-only.
- `simulate_copy_fill` **breaks** the book walk on a zero-size level instead of
  **continuing**, truncating the fill (the sub-floor case correctly continues).
- `won` means "the outcome settled true" in `realize()` but "we made money" in
  `realize_exit()`; consumers (hit_rate, Wilson LB, the demote hold) cannot tell
  them apart, so many small profitable exits plus a few large resolution losses
  can dodge the blacklist.
- `outcome_index` defaults to 0 with no cross-check against `token_id`; a feed
  row missing `outcomeIndex` on a NO-side buy books an inverted result.
- `telegram_bot._stamped` / `_sensitivity` skip the dust quarantine.
  (`strategy_compare._book_stats` did too; fixed in `bab44f7`.)
- `split_half_corr` rounds before the floor comparison: a true `-5e-5` becomes
  `-0.0`, and `-0.0 >= 0.0` is True. **Deliberately not fixed** — every
  sign-preserving fix distorts the displayed magnitude by more than the 1e-5 it
  corrects. Revisit only if the floor moves off zero.
- P1-6's "can never deadlock" guarantee is silently coupled to
  `COPY_PAPER_CATEGORY_GATE`: with the gate off, `stamped` is permanently
  False, removing the sole re-admission channel. The price-bucket map is also
  built book-wide across all categories, so once each of the 5 buckets clears
  n=15 an unstamped wallet is blocked in every price band.

### 9.4 The §7 decision, written before the number exists

Agreed now so the result cannot pick the rule. `/verdict` offers three arms;
until today only two had content.

- **RETIRE** — B's clean-era split-half corr ≤ 0 with ≥15 wallets at n≥10,
  **and** combined at-their-price ROI < 0. This is §7 met. Stop tuning
  wallet-copying. The P0–P2 harness (honest measurement, cost model, paper
  books, era scoping) is generic and is what a rules-based strategy would
  reuse — retiring the thesis is not discarding the work.
- **HOLD** — corr > 0 **and** at-price ROI ≥ 0. The thesis survives; nothing
  changes; re-read at the next boundary.
- **RECALIBRATE** — the mixed case (a marginal miss: corr within ±0.05 of zero,
  or ROI negative but within one standard error). Concretely it means: extend
  the era by a *relative* 30 days (see the bug in §9.2 — the current knob adds
  3), and apply the cut that was deliberately **not** made mid-experiment:
  drop sports pool-wide — but **re-derive the premise first** (`/slice B`):
  as of 2026-08-02 sports does NOT lose in both books at their own price. It
  is **~62% of settled A+B copies, ~55% in the clean era** (live ledgers, 2026-08-02; the ledgers
  append continuously, so treat the share as approximate and re-derive rather
  than quoting a row count. §1.5's 333-of-415 is the 2026-07-25 snapshot and
  is NOT current).
  The reason to hold the cut until the boundary is not the share but the
  **wallet count**: dropping sports takes book B's clean-era wallets at n≥10
  from **27 to 11**, under the ≥15 bar — it would convert a readable verdict
  into an undefined one, which is strictly worse than either outcome. Both
  figures independently re-derived twice on 2026-08-02; the wallet counts
  agreed exactly, the row counts drifted by one between runs minutes apart,
  which is why the share is stated as a percentage and not a tally.
  So it is the content of the recalibrate arm, not a change to make now.

**Frozen until 08-22** (anything that changes what the verdict measures): the
sports cut, any new live book, any promotion or copy-gate threshold change, any
ranking change that alters which trades enter the sample. Plumbing fixes
(§9.1/§9.2) are not in this category — a silently truncating fetch is a defect,
not a design parameter, and leaving it running would hand the negative result
an obvious alternative explanation.

### 9.5 Fade-the-hot-wallet — first read (2026-08-02, read-only)

The most-trusted finding (§1.3) is that a wallet looking good is slightly
*negative* information. Nobody had tried inverting it on purpose. Computed on
the live ledgers, at-their-price (fill-model independent), dust excluded,
wallets with n≥10 settled, split chronologically in half.


The result at the time of writing: following COLD wallets beat following HOT
ones by roughly 8 percentage points, in BOTH books and on both signs.
**But do not read this as an edge yet**, for two reasons that must be settled first:

1. **This is exactly what regression to the mean produces under a ZERO-signal
   null.** Selecting on "first half was positive" selects partly on noise, and
   noise regresses. A fade edge of this shape is the *expected* artifact, not
   evidence against it. It needs a null model (shuffle the halves, or bootstrap
   the wallet assignment) before it means anything.
2. **The magnitude does not clear modeled costs.** Cold-wallet second halves are
   low-single-digit (A) and mid-single-digit (B) at-their-price gross, against
   a modeled round-trip cost around 10% — materially less if the entry-only
   correction in §9.2 is right. Only book B is even in the conversation, and on
   a small slice of capital and wallets. Re-derive before acting.

It is also **not independent evidence** — it is a re-read of the same rows §1.3
already reported. Treat it as a pre-registered hypothesis for after 08-22, with
its own kill bar written before it is tested, not as a reason to soften the §7
verdict.

**One useful side-fact:** book B clears the §7 15-wallet bar comfortably on the
all-time sample — but §7 counts *clean-era* wallets, which is a smaller number.
That gap is exactly what the readability witness (§9.1) now reports every
morning.

### 9.6 Verifier round 1 — one defect in this session's own fix

The byte governor shipped in `7f5feb6` **failed open at the exact disk state it
exists for**. `allowance = max(0, total + free - reserve)` clamps to `0` when
free space reaches the reserve; `0` is falsy, and the eviction test read that as
"no budget configured" — so the governor switched itself off under pressure, and
`min(ceiling, 0)` discarded the explicit 5G/1.5G ceilings too. It was ~0.64G of
free space from firing in prod. Compounding it, the same commit raised the
rescache count cap 120k → 400k, which is +1.1G of growth headroom in precisely
the OFF state. Fixed in `d39440d`: the test is `max_bytes is not None`, and the
allowance carries a floor (default 0.5G, injectable) so real pressure shrinks
the cache to a working set instead of either ignoring the budget or emptying it
and forcing a full refetch into an already-429-ing API.

Also from the same pass: the wcache prune now logs (it was the one silent lever,
on the biggest thing on the disk); the §7 readability witness reports **both**
books, since A sits at 4w against the 15w bar and a B-only witness would have
said "readable" while A printed inconclusive on the day; and two comments that
the same commit had made stale were corrected.

**Verifier's independent measurements on live prod, worth keeping:** §7 is
already readable on B (**27 wallets at n≥10, bar 15**, 19 days out). Both
promoted wallets read `READY=False` with *and* without the new clean-era bar —
they already fail on paper-ROI, at-price-ROI and the promotion floor — so the
30-copy default changes nothing today and only closes the artifact-era hole.
Zero secrets in prod logs (no bot-token pattern, no 64-hex key, no setkey echo).

**Still open from that pass, queued (not fixed):** the go-live
`min_split_half_corr` bar's wallet floor is only 3 (`split_half_corr` defaults
`min_wallets=3`, and `/golive` uses the default) — it is not unguarded, but 3-4
wallets clears a `>= 0` bar about half the time under the null, and it has been
seen *passing* at `+0.45 (4w)`. The settled-count half of that hole was closed,
this half was not. Direction is safe (the gate is strictly stricter and
PREVIEW_MODE is on). Same item as §9.7.1 — keep the two in step.

### 9.7 Go-live preconditions — check these before flipping PREVIEW_MODE=false

The manual flip is the one true one-way door. `/golive` renders the mechanical
gate; this list is what the gate does **not** yet check and a human must.

**These four are now rendered in the `/golive` output itself**, so the flip
decision carries them at the point it is made rather than depending on anyone
finding this section. If you edit them here, edit `_handle_golive` too.

1. **`min_split_half_corr`'s wallet floor is only 3.** `split_half_corr`
   enforces `min_wallets=3`, so the check is not unguarded — but a Pearson
   correlation over 3-4 points clears a `>= 0` bar about half the time under
   the null, so it contributes almost no discrimination at the present book
   size. Read the `(Nw)` count next to it, not just the sign. (Round-1 verifier finding, s-r7m3qk;
   deliberately not code-fixed because the gate is strictly stricter with it
   than without and PREVIEW_MODE is on.)
2. **The clob credential path.** `py_clob_client` logs
   `request error status=400 url=/auth/api-key` a few times a day. Benign in
   PREVIEW (known create-or-derive fallback, self-heals), but it is the
   credential derivation a real order depends on. Confirm a successful API-key
   derivation in the logs before the flip, not after.
3. **The cost model bias (§9.2).** Modeled cost currently charges a round-trip
   spread against a book that redeems at par. Any go-live sizing computed off
   `@net` is using a number biased ~4-6pp too negative.
4. **All-time vs clean-era.** Every *realized* bar not labelled "clean era" is
   all-time (the unlabelled `active within Nd` bar is a recency check, not a
   PnL one); only `COPY_GOLIVE_MIN_CLEAN_SETTLED` and the two honest checks are
   era-scoped. If the wallet's all-time record is much better than its clean-era
   record, the difference is the fill artifact, not skill.

### 9.8 Re-derived 2026-08-02 — §7 does not fire today, on EITHER leg

Round-7/8 verification forced a re-derivation instead of carrying figures
forward. Two prose claims in §9 were false, and correcting them changes what
the 08-22 verdict is expected to say. **No ROI figures are reproduced here** — run
`docker exec poly-poly-bot python scripts/rebaseline_ledger.py --era`, or
`/pnl` and `/slice B`. That command prints both books, the combined figures,
the persistence pair and the §7 bar in one screen.

1. **"Sports loses in both books" is false.** In book B's clean era sports is
   solidly positive at their own price, and it is not even the worst slice
   (`other` is worse at `@net`). It loses only after modeled costs. §1.5's
   finding was real on 2026-07-25 data and does not hold now, yet it was the
   sole stated premise for the recalibrate arm's sports cut — re-derive before
   applying that cut.

2. **Both §7 legs are currently unmet.** §7 fires only on clean-era at-price
   ROI **< 0** AND split-half corr **≤ 0** across ≥15 wallets at n≥10. Today
   combined at-price ROI is positive, and book B's clean-era persistence is
   **positive across 27 wallets** — above the 15-wallet bar, so it is a
   measured result, not an unmeasurable one. §9.4's RETIRE arm assumed both
   would be met. On today's data the tree resolves to **HOLD** (corr > 0 and
   at-price ROI ≥ 0), and it resolves cleanly — this is not an ambiguous state.

3. **The cost model does NOT decide whether §7 fires.** An earlier draft of
   this section said it did; that was wrong. §7 and §9.4's arms are defined on
   **gross** at-price ROI and split-half correlation, and neither is a function
   of modeled cost. What the §9.2 cost bug decides is the **economic** read —
   whether there is money in this after costs — because among the COMBINED figures the §7 arms read, `@net` is the one that
   is negative. (Book A is negative at at-their-price too, on both windows —
   this is a statement about the combined arms, not a universal.) Both questions matter; they are not the
   same question, and only the second one turns on §9.2.

**This is not "the thesis is winning", and the caveats are load-bearing:**

- Persistence at 27 wallets carries a standard error of roughly 0.2, so a
  reading near zero is weak evidence either way. The honest statement is "no
  *demonstrated* persistence", not "no persistence" — and equally not
  "persistence established". §1.3's negative correlation was a 2026-07-25
  measurement; it has since flipped sign, which is itself what §1.3 predicted
  wallet-level ROI would do.
- **The combined A+B statistic double-counts.** A and B copy the same
  watchlist, and about three quarters of book A's clean-era settled rows share
  a `copy_id` with a book B row at an identical `their_price` — at
  at-their-price those are literally the same observation counted twice, so
  the combined `n` is inflated by roughly a fifth and its standard error is
  understated on top of §1.2's already-weak t. By dollars the combined figure
  is mostly book B wearing a combined label. De-duping to one row per
  `copy_id` moves clean-era at-price **further above zero** on either
  tie-break, so the *sign* of the ROI leg is robust — but §7 pre-registered
  "combined" (§1.2 defines it as A+B) and the freeze forbids swapping the
  statistic now. Recorded here so 08-22 is not ambushed by it.
- A positive gross at-price ROI on a book whose wallet selection has no
  demonstrated persistence is consistent with beta — a rising market lifting
  everything copied — rather than with skill at picking wallets.

---

**Why this section carries almost no numbers.** §9 was written in one session
and then failed round after round of verification on a single recurring defect:
a hand-copied figure that was stale, mis-tallied, or wrong at birth — including
some written into the very commits that added rules against them. Every
machine-derived figure held; every hand-copied one rotted, some within the
hour. So the numbers live in the surfaces that compute them
(`/pnl`, `/slice`, `/verdict`, `scripts/rebaseline_ledger.py --era`) and this
file carries the reasoning, the decisions, and the commands. **If you are
tempted to paste a number in here, paste the command instead.**

## 10. Pre-flip execution measurement — 2026-08-16 (run s-k4m9dp)

The question this section answers: **how fast are we told a target traded, and
how much worse is our entry price than theirs?** Both were unmeasurable before
this run, and both decide whether book B's numbers can survive contact with a
real order book.

### 10.1 §9.7-2 is CLOSED — the CLOB credential path works

`/golive`'s precondition 2 asked for proof of a successful API-key derivation
before the flip. It exists: `create_clob_client()` (`runner.py:304`) sits
**outside** both preview guards, so every boot exercises it, and the boot log
shows `Deriving API credentials from wallet...` → a 400 on `/auth/api-key` →
`CLOB client authenticated successfully`. The 400 is the documented
create-then-derive fallback, not a failure. Re-check with:

```
docker logs poly-poly-bot 2>&1 | grep -i "CLOB client authenticated"
```

### 10.2 The CLOB price contract was wrong in three places — and the books are clean

Found by probing the live CLOB, not by reading code. All three were shipped
defects on the real-order path:

1. `get_price` returns `{"price": "0.68"}`; `market_price` called `float()` on
   the object, so `fetch_market_snapshot` returned `None` on **every** live
   call, silently, on the debug channel.
2. `side` names the side of the **book**, not your intent: `side=BUY` is the
   best **bid**, `side=SELL` the best **ask**. This was inverted, so fixing (1)
   alone would have crossed the book and still returned `None` — or, with the
   crossed-book guard relaxed, quoted a BUY at the bid and understated the
   entry penalty by the whole spread.
3. `trade_executor._get_market_snapshot` read `bids[0]`/`asks[0]`, but the CLOB
   returns bids **ascending** and asks **descending**, so index 0 is the worst
   price on each side. It produced a wildly crossed top-of-book, which rejected
   every copy as drift and would have posted a real limit near the top of the
   book had one slipped the gates.

**The paper ledgers are NOT affected, on four independent grounds**, so the
08-22 verdict data stands: `simulate_copy_fill` sorts the asks
(`copy_paper.py:112`); book B never reads a book at all; exits go through
`fetch_bids`, which sorts before indexing; and `fetch_market_snapshot`'s only
consumer repo-wide is the new shadow-quote module. Verify with:

```
git diff 81540af..HEAD -- poly_poly_bot/src/copy_trading/copy_paper.py
```

Every fake in the test suite had encoded the wire contract wrongly, which is
why a green suite described a function that failed on every real call.
`tests/test_clob_contract.py` now pins the real shapes and the real side
mapping.

### 10.3 What is measured now, and the two biases that are excluded

`shadow_quote` prices every **detected** trade against the live book with
`order_executor.quote_copy_order` — the same function the live executor uses,
so the measurement cannot drift from the thing it measures. It observes the
raw detected list **before any admission rule**, because book A's fill gate
censors exactly the copies whose price ran away: a fill measurement taken
after the gates is a survivor's average.

Two biases are recorded, excluded from the statistics, and reported as counts
rather than quietly averaged in:

- **`boot_flush`** — on the first sweep after a restart the detector re-emits
  its whole `COPY_PAPER_MAX_AGE_S` look-back, so those trades' "latency" is
  the age of the window. This repo redeploys on every push, so admitting them
  would make the headline number mostly measure the last deploy.
- **`quote_lag_s`** — how long a trade sat in the sampler's own queue before
  being priced. Beyond `MAX_QUOTE_LAG_S` the row describes our delay, not the
  market's move.

**What the entry-price number still cannot tell you.**
A sample here is one detected trade priced against one book read. When several
copies of the same market arrive in one burst they are priced off one cached
read, so they are one observation wearing several row numbers. `/speed` counts
the distinct book reads next to the headline and stays silent on whether speed
is worth paying for until there are at least 5 distinct book reads. The market
count gates the warning above that line, not the line itself.

Two things follow. First, the sign of the entry penalty is a reading, not a
settled answer, until the distinct-read count is in the dozens. Second, rows
written before this run's deploy do not carry the field that makes
independence measurable, so they are dropped from the price statistics and
counted on the panel. **The price sample restarts from 2026-08-16. The latency
sample does not.**

The per-wallet table carries the same limit more sharply: most wallets sit at
one or two samples and are marked thin. Read it as which wallets are reachable
at all, not as a ranking.

None of this blocks the flip. It means the entry-price number should not be
the only input to it. Give it a few days of collection before you read the
sign as an answer.

Read the numbers off the surface, never from this file:

```
/speed [days]        # latency + entry penalty + per-wallet breakdown
/live                # the real-money interlock and what is blocking it
```

### 10.4 The flip is now a two-key interlock, and it ships disarmed

A real order requires **both** `LIVE_ARM_ENABLED=true` in the VM environment
(the owner's key, default false, not settable from inside the process) **and**
`/live CONFIRM` (the moment's key). `live_mode.is_preview()` fails closed on
any error, and a persisted arm goes inert the moment the env key is pulled.
The order-placement gate reads the interlock; **startup** guards still read
`CONFIG.preview_mode`, so a live boot *prepares* and the arm *releases*.

**The admission thresholds have never met real book data.** `/check`'s drift
gate (300bps) and spread gate (500bps) sat downstream of the snapshot function
that returned `None` on every live call (§10.2), so every copy was rejected
before either threshold was consulted. They are untested against production
books, not tuned. A first look says the spread gate is the live one: a
meaningful minority of real book reads sit above 500bps. Re-derive rather than
trusting a figure written here (the §9 rule applies):

```
docker exec poly-poly-bot python -c "
from src.copy_trading import shadow_quote
reads = {(r.get('token_id'), r.get('book_ts')): r['spread_bps']
         for r in shadow_quote.load_rows() if r.get('spread_bps') is not None}
print(len(reads), 'reads;', sum(1 for v in reads.values() if v > 500), 'over 500bps')"
```

Expect the first live session to admit a different number of copies than you
assume, in either direction, and watch both gates before you conclude anything
about the strategy from the fill count.

**The genuinely irreversible step is the boot, not the order.** With
`PREVIEW_MODE=false`, `runner.py` fires `check_and_set_approvals`, the
auto-redeemer and inventory reconcile against the real proxy wallet — real
on-chain transactions that cost gas, before any order and regardless of the
arm. `/live` renders this warning at the point the decision is made.

## 11. Month one on real money — 2026-09-05 (run s-yr3unh)

The month's read, the go-live footing, and the owner's remaining steps. No
derived number is written here (the §9 rule): every figure lives behind a
command, and the run report on the Desk carries the snapshot with its date.

### 11.1 How to read the month

```
# the honest book read, clean era (realized, at their price, net, persistence)
docker exec poly-poly-bot python scripts/rebaseline_ledger.py --era

# the counterfactual at the REAL quoted book, per book (coverage is stated)
docker exec poly-poly-bot python -c "
from src.copy_trading import virtual_ledger, era_state; import json
era = era_state.era_floor_ts('/app/data/ab_race_state.json')
for lab, p in [('B', '/app/data/copy_paper_ledger_b.jsonl'), ('A', '/app/data/copy_paper_ledger.jsonl')]:
    print(lab, json.dumps(virtual_ledger.replay(p, min_opened_ts=era), indent=1))"

# who passes the go-live gate plus set Z's rails today (dry run, decides nothing)
docker exec poly-poly-bot python scripts/seed_zset.py

# every never-run real-money path, as checks that can fail
docker exec poly-poly-bot python scripts/golive_drills.py
```

In Telegram: `/zset candidates` (one card per passer, admit by tap),
`/live` (interlock plus the bankroll governor), `/speed`, `/canary`.

### 11.2 What this run changed on the money path

- **The bankroll governor** (`live_budget.py`). One knob, `LIVE_BUDGET_USD`
  (deploy default 310, for 400 SGD), derives every live cap as a fraction:
  per copy, per market (two copies a side), per day, open at once. Live
  sizing is CLOSED without it; live, the effective budget is the smaller of
  the stated number and the on-chain USDC. The tier's copy trigger is now the
  evidence base's `COPY_PAPER_MIN_USD`, not `STRATEGY_1B_MIN_TRADER_BET`: the
  strategy that trades is the strategy the paper book measured.
- **The floor.** A fourth self-disarm trigger: realized equity (USDC plus open
  positions at cost, never marked) under `LIVE_BUDGET_DRAWDOWN_FRAC` below the
  stated budget pulls the arm and says why. A fresh `/live CONFIRM` after the
  trip overrides it for that arm session.
- **The guard's clock.** Stale-feed now means the live poller has not
  completed a successful poll, not that the market was quiet; the self-disarm
  edge is logged while unarmed and messaged only when there is an arm to pull.
- **The redeemer** retries its positions read with backoff and raises after
  the last attempt; a failed read is unknown, never "nothing to redeem".
- **Set-Z admission is the owner's tap.** `/zset candidates` renders every
  gate passer as one card (clean-era ROI, real-quote replay with its sample
  size, entry penalty, the concentration rail with its reason, share of profit
  from mirrored exits, slices, idle days) and one button; the tap re-runs the
  gate at that moment and `zset.admit` decides. The seeding script and the
  cards share one evaluation (`zset_candidates.evaluate`).
- **The watcher on the box (run s-qbzbrw, 2026-09-22).** `scripts/ai_sre.py`
  runs as a second container from the same image (`poly-poly-sre`, started by
  `deploy.sh` next to the bot, no PRIVATE_KEY in its env, logs read-only).
  Every `SRE_TICK_S` it fingerprints the new important lines
  (`ops_fingerprint`: ids, amounts and titles collapsed, one row per fault
  with a count) and wakes `claude -p` only on a NEW fingerprint or a rate
  crossing. The verdict is one of nothing, note, escalate (one Telegram
  line), disarm (the bot's own `live_mode.disarm`, never arm) or fix (a
  unified diff applied to a fresh clone, the FULL suite, then a push to
  main if the diff touches no money-path file, else a branch `sre/<fp>` and
  the owner merges from the phone). Proof of a fix is two counters, never an
  opinion: fingerprint hits after the action and runs of the path it names;
  a recurrence within 24 h of its OWN push reverts that push. Rate limits:
  `SRE_MAX_WAKES_PER_HOUR`, `SRE_MAX_PUSHES_PER_DAY`,
  `SRE_MAX_USD_PER_DIAGNOSIS`. Every wake is a row in
  `data/ops-thoughts.jsonl` (woke because, looked at, concluded, did,
  proof); the hourly digest prints it and the 08:00 UTC line carries one
  summary line under the real-money line (`ops_watch.watcher_line`). It
  pushes over a write deploy key (`SRE_DEPLOY_KEY` secret, a file mounted
  read-only at `/run/sre_deploy_key`). Read it: `cat ~/app/data/ops-thoughts.jsonl`
  and `docker logs poly-poly-sre` on the VM.
- **The analyst (run s-qbzbrw, 2026-09-22).** `scripts/ai_analyst.py` runs
  once a day inside the sidecar (`ANALYST_ENABLED`, off until the watcher's
  ledger shows a clean day). It prices the week's declined copies at their
  price from book B (`counterfactual`: declined by reason, how many settled,
  what they would have made at the live stake) and asks Claude for at most
  `ANALYST_MAX_PROPOSALS`: a `limit` (one of the parameters in
  `live_limits.TABLE`, moved inside its band for 24 h, money down only, the
  owner's number is the ceiling and the fallback; the bot reads
  `live_limits.current(...)` at the call sites), a `pr` (a diff applied to a
  fresh clone, the full suite, pushed to `analyst/<day>-<slug>`, never main,
  the compare link on the phone), or a `note`. Every run is a row in
  `data/ops-thoughts.jsonl`; the digest prints the limits in force
  (`live_limits.lines`).
- **Lag has a price (run s-qbzbrw, phase 2).** The chain reader hands its
  stamp of each set-Z BUY fill through `shadow_quote.register_sink` under its
  own copy_id (`chain:<0xtx>-<token>`), so the observer quotes the same fill
  twice: at the chain's detection and at the api's. `two_clocks.lag_cost`
  pairs the two quotes and prices the delay at the live stake (the shares the
  stake buys at the chain quote, times how far the ask moved by the api
  quote): an ESTIMATE from two snapshots, printed as one line under the 08:00
  UTC message (`ops_watch.lag_cost_line`) and in the digest, "collecting,
  n=0" until fills pair. Rulings of the same round: the SRE pushes fixes to
  branches only unless `SRE_PUSH_MAIN=true` (a standing process on main is a
  self-graded deploy check); the chain stays pinned as a shadow
  (`ONCHAIN_SHADOW=true` in deploy.yml) until the owner reads a week of the
  two-clocks line and unpins; two-clocks rows are written once per (source,
  id), replays after a restart are counted and printed, never a reason.
- **The leaderboard says where each wallet stands at the door.** `/wallets`
  ranks by all-time net PnL, a number the gate never reads, and its old row
  verdict (PROMOTE-READY on 15 settled and positive PnL) printed READY next
  to wallets Z refuses. Each row now carries the gate's own standing from
  `zset_candidates.standing_map` (in Z, evicted, passes today, or the checks
  it fails with their detail), and the header counts Z, today's passers and
  the auto-admit state. A good-looking wallet that is not in Z is one the
  gate is refusing; the row names the check.
- **The canary.** `/canary CONFIRM` makes the next set-Z copy that passes every
  rail go out at the market's minimum size, pulls the arm the moment it
  posts, and reports their price, quoted ask, order price, fill, penalty and
  latency once the verifier sees the fill. The first `/live CONFIRM` that has
  never seen a canary fire stages it by default.
- **The rehearsal ledger** (`rehearsal.py`): the counterfactual at the owner's
  caps in dollars, per set-Z wallet, in the 08:00 UTC block next to a
  real-money line (bankroll, distance to the floor, realized today from
  redeemer rows only).

### 11.3 What the data said, in words (the numbers are behind §11.1)

Book A is dead at any price. Book B is marginally positive at their price and
negative once re-settled at the real quoted book, and its clean-era profit
sits in mirrored exits. A live entry-penalty cap was tested against the replay
and rejected: the high-penalty copies did better, not worse. Real-quote
coverage exists only from 2026-08-16, so the read leans on about three weeks.

**Correction (verifier, same run).** An earlier draft of this section said the
two set-Z wallets are "pure hold-to-settlement and carry none of that edge".
That is a false universal and the run's own card disproves it: `0x3f3aa700`
has no early exits, but `0xf49614e6` closed 25 of its 58 clean-era copies by
mirroring the target's SELL, and that is a large share of its profit. Read the
"mirrored exits" line on each `/zset candidates` card rather than any sentence
written here.

**The live exit rule is not the paper book's, and the difference is not
modelled.** Book B closes the WHOLE position when a watched wallet sells above
its feed floor. Live tier 1b mirrors a SELL as a copy sized like any other, a
percentage of the target's notional capped by the governor, not "close what we
hold". The entry trigger no longer gates exits (fixed this run: step 3 of
`tiered_risk_manager` is BUY-only, because an entry filter was silently
blocking our own exits), but partial-close versus full-close remains a real
divergence between the evidence and the wire. Since exits are where book B's
edge sits, treat the rehearsal dollars as an upper bound on the exit leg until
a live ledger says otherwise. Closing that gap is deferred to month two on
purpose: changing exit sizing before a single real fill exists would be tuning
against a model rather than against evidence.

### 11.4 The owner's steps, in order

1. Fund the proxy wallet with USDC and the EOA with POL for gas (approvals
   fire at the first live boot; every redeem is a transaction).
2. Merge the go-live PR (`PREVIEW_MODE=false` plus `LIVE_ARM_ENABLED=true` in
   deploy.yml). Merging is turning the key; the deploy boots the bot live.
3. `/live CONFIRM`. The canary is staged automatically.
4. After the canary report, `/live CONFIRM` again to trade at the governor's
   size. `/zset candidates` to widen Z; `/zset drop` to narrow it.

### 11.5 Deferred, with grounds

- Per-slice copying inside an admitted wallet (category or price band):
  defer[scope] until the real ledger holds per-slice evidence; then mirror the
  P1-6 gate at the same knob and floor, never a second way.
- Prober headroom for a set Z wider than three wallets: defer[scope].
- Depth-priced ticket sizing: rejected at this bankroll.
