"""Smarkets HTTP API v3 provider for sharp tennis odds.

Smarkets is a London-based betting exchange. Its public REST API serves the
same order book that backs the Smarkets website, with no special API key /
account / payment required for read-only quote access. Empirical testing
shows the unauthenticated quote endpoint returns essentially real-time
(sub-second tick) prices for in-play tennis matches; the "delayed" warning in
their OpenAPI spec applies only to historical/archived data, not live quotes.

Why we use this instead of The Odds API
---------------------------------------
The Odds API serves Pinnacle's *closing* prices, frozen the moment a match
goes in-play. That makes it useless for the tennis arb thesis ("Polymarket
lags sharp books during live matches"). Smarkets, being an exchange, has no
"close" — its price keeps updating tick-by-tick as long as the order book
exists. Comparing the live Smarkets mid against the live Polymarket price
during a match is the right shape of signal.

Why REST polling and not the legacy streaming SDK
-------------------------------------------------
Smarkets had a TCP+protobuf streaming SDK (`smk_python_sdk`) that was
archived in December 2019 and only supports Python ≤3.5. It is not
maintained and probably won't run cleanly on the bot's Python 3.12
container. The current public-facing protocol is the HTTP API v3 documented
at https://docs.smarkets.com/, which is REST polling (no WebSocket / SSE).
With batched market_ids (up to 200 per call) and the 20 req/min unauth rate
limit, we can refresh ~50 active tennis markets every 5 seconds — close
enough to "real-time" for the arb use case.

Architecture
------------
Each scan call does (at most) three HTTP requests:
  1. GET /v3/events/?type=tennis_match&state=upcoming + GET state=live
     → list of all upcoming and in-play tennis events (cached 5 min)
  2. GET /v3/events/{event_ids}/markets/ joined with commas
     → list of markets per event; we keep only "Match winner" markets
  3. GET /v3/markets/{market_ids}/quotes/ batched ≤200 IDs per call
     → current bid/ask ladder per contract, parsed into MatchOdds

Player names come from the event name (split on " vs "). Doubles markets
(player names containing "/") are skipped. Tour (ATP/WTA/Challenger/ITF) is
inferred from the event's full_slug.

Rate limits and self-throttling
-------------------------------
Smarkets returns three headers on every response:
  x-ratelimit-limit        → 20 (unauth) or 50 (API user)
  x-ratelimit-remaining    → calls left in the current window
  x-ratelimit-reset        → seconds until the window rolls

When `remaining` drops below the safety floor, the provider sleeps until
reset before the next call. On HTTP 429 it backs off using the reset header.
Rate limits are tracked per-host so a long backoff doesn't starve other
endpoints (none in this case — only Smarkets).
