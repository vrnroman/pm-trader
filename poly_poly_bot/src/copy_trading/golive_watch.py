"""Go-live readiness watch — pings the owner the moment a PROMOTED wallet
crosses the full ``/golive`` bar, instead of the owner polling ``/golive`` by
hand (owner ask, 2026-07-17: 0x4861 sat 4 settles short of READY and nothing
would have said so when it got there).

Edge-triggered with persisted state (``data/golive_watch.json``):

  * not-ready -> READY   → one 🟢 alert naming the wallet + the /golive command
  * READY -> not-ready   → one ⏸ alert (so real money is never flipped on a
    readiness that has already decayed)
  * no repeats while the state holds; a wallet that drops back and re-crosses
    alerts again (re-armed). First sight of a not-ready wallet is silent.

A transition is recorded ONLY after its alert actually sent (``send`` returned
truthy), so a Telegram hiccup retries next cycle instead of losing the signal.
Pure logic with injectable IO — the live wrapper in ``main.py`` supplies the
ledger, the promoted set, thresholds from CONFIG, and the Telegram sender.
