"""In-bot daemon for continuous copyable-wallet discovery (Strategy 1b feeder).

Every ``cycle_interval_s`` it runs the discovery funnel (universe -> robust
skill -> lead-lag copyability), then:
  * writes the qualified wallets to ``watchlist_path`` (atomically) so the
    paper-copy harness picks them up on its next cycle — AUTO-PAPER;
  * Telegram-pings each *newly* qualified wallet so you can analyze it;
  * persists state so restarts don't re-ping and decayed wallets are dropped.

Places NO real orders and never touches the live ``.env`` tiers — promotion to
real capital stays a manual decision after you review the paper PnL.

        ``result.newly_qualified`` and ``result.new_state.on_watchlist`` so it
