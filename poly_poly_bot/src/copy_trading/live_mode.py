"""The live/preview interlock — the one door to real money.

Before this module, flipping to real trading meant editing `PREVIEW_MODE` in
the VM's `.env` and restarting the container: `CONFIG.preview_mode` is read
once at import and frozen. That is slow at the exact moment speed matters,
and it is also unaudited — nothing records who flipped it, when, or why.

So the flip becomes a runtime decision with a **two-key interlock**, and both
keys are needed to place a real order:

  1. ``LIVE_ARM_ENABLED=true`` in the environment — the owner's key. It is
     false by default, it can only be set on the VM, and no chat message,
     script, or agent can set it.
  2. ``/live CONFIRM`` in Telegram — the moment's key. It writes the arm
     record below.

Either key alone leaves the bot in preview. This is deliberate: key 1 cannot
be turned by anything running inside the process, and key 2 cannot be turned
by anything that is not the owner's own Telegram chat. The arm is also
**disarmed by default on every restart** unless it was explicitly persisted,
so a crash-loop can never wake up trading.

`is_preview()` is the single question the trading paths ask. It fails CLOSED:
any error reading the arm state means preview.
