"""Runtime data layer for continuous wallet discovery.

Network IO tuned for an always-on loop (rather than a one-shot backtest):
  * TTL-cached wallet activity on disk, so each sweep sees fresh trades without
    re-pulling everything every time;
  * bounded concurrency so discovery never starves the trading threads;
  * shutdown-aware so a stop request doesn't wait out a full sweep.

Pure analysis is reused from ``trader_scoring`` and ``lead_lag``; this module
only fetches and assembles ``Eval`` rows for ``discovery.run_discovery_cycle``.

    NOTE: the data-API hard-caps ``/trades`` pagination at **offset 3000**
    (beyond it returns HTTP 400 "max historical activity offset of 3000
    exceeded"), so a single filter exposes only its ~3500 most-recent trades.
    We widen the net two ways:

    * **stake tiers** ($3000 → $100, high first so the strongest wallets seed
      the set and modest-bet insiders are still caught);
    * **filter expansion** (``expand_filters``): each tier is also queried per
      ``side`` (BUY/SELL) and ``takerOnly`` (true=takers, false=incl. makers).
      Each filter combination is its own newest-first feed, so the union covers
      more distinct wallets within the same recent window — at the cost of ~20×
      the requests. Off by default; turn on for a wider (but slower) sweep.

    ``window_s`` makes this an *active-in-the-last-N-seconds* universe: trades
    older than the cutoff are skipped, and because the feed is newest-first we
    stop paging a filter combo as soon as it crosses the cutoff (so a 24h sweep
    rarely needs the full offset budget). ``window_s=0`` disables the window and
    pages each combo to ``max_offset`` (the legacy top-stake behaviour).

    Stops a combo when it runs dry, the offset budget (``max_offset``, capped at
    the API's 3000) is hit, the window cutoff is crossed, or we've collected
    ``target`` unique wallets. A short ``page_pause_s`` between pages keeps us
