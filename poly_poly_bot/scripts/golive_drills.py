"""Rehearse every real-money path that has never actually run.

    python scripts/golive_drills.py

Four things are true of this system today and all four are uncomfortable:
the auto-redeemer has never fired, `recover_pending_orders` has never
reconciled a real order, the proxy wallet balance has never been checked
against a live session, and the VM has gone network-dead before. Each is a
sentence in a doc rather than a check that can fail.

This turns each into a drill with a green/red result, the same shape as a test
gate. Everything here is in-process and read-only: no order is placed, nothing
is armed, nothing on chain is touched. That boundary is not squeamishness, it
is structural, because `PREVIEW_MODE=false` fires token approvals, the
auto-redeemer and an inventory reconcile at BOOT, before any order and
regardless of the runtime arm, so there is no such thing as "drill it live but
carefully". Live is live.

Exit code is 0 when every drill passes, 1 otherwise, so it can gate a deploy.
